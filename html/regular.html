			<h6>JRS. ACTING: “STORY BOOK SHORTS”</h6>
			<p>
			Just when you thought you knew those beloved bedtime stories by heart, something comes along and throws a wrench into the carefully written lives of all your favorite characters! Can the cast of this comedic play sort out their stories in time to save all the happy endings, or will chaos become the new normal?

			In addition to rehearsing their play each week, students will emerge from this class with an introductory knowledge of the basics of theatre--from stage directions to audience etiquette and a whole new vocabulary of theatre terms in between.</p>

			<h6>TUESDAY TEENS MUSICAL THEATRE</h6>
			<p>	This class gives your student in the full Musical Theatre
				experience--acting, singing, dancing, and the thrill of
				performing some of the most beloved stories of all time.
				Seussical the Musical is the Tony Award-winning production that centers around Horton the Elephant and his mission to save the tiny Whos living on the dust speck only he can hear. Narrated by the mischievous Cat in the Hat, the tale follows both JoJo and his giant elephant friend through perils of Wickersham monkey gang, the Sour Kangaroo, a selfish Mayzie La Bird, hunters who sell Horton to the circus, and some serious winter weather. Only Gertrude McFuzz recognizes his “kind and powerful heart” and pledges to come to Horton’s aid. Essential skills development is provided through the audition process, blocking, line memorization, choreography, and vocal performance. Team work and positive peer feedback are integral elements of our musical theatre program as well. Each musical theatre class forms it's own individual Seussical cast and culminates in two end-of-semester performances for family and friends.

			<h6>VOCAL PERFORMANCE</h6>
			<p>				
				Taught by our amazing vocal coach, Britni Favero, this group class focuses on technique as well as stage presence. Students will work on solo numbers, exploring a variety of music genres and performing in front of their class at least twice a month. An end-of-semester recital for friends and family in our theater will give our aspiring singers a chance to showcase their talents. Student confidence is built on positive peer feedback and a supportive environment. Space is limited and these classes will fill quickly.
